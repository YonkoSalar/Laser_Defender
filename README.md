# Laser_Defender
This game was a recreation of the original Space Shooter using the assets(link down below). For this game the first level was made with some effects using the unity particle system. This game turned out pretty well, but could need some tweeks here and there. This was made to get a better grasp of the Unity engine has offer.

## Please Note
