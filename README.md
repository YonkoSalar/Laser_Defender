# Laser_Defender
I wanted to learn how to use Unity and started learning about how to program a game.
Therefore, i created this Block Breaker clone while taking the GameDev.tv Unity 2D Course on Udemy.

This game was a recreation of the original Space Shooter using the assets(link down below). For this game the first level was made with some effects using the unity particle system. This game turned out pretty well, but could need some tweeks here and there. This was made to get a better grasp of the Unity engine has offer.

## Please Note
I only added the code for this game, if interested in looking at this course check out this link:
